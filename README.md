# Car Rental Python challenge

It's a 5 level challenge about a python script that is managing a peer to peer car rental service.  

The input is formatted in a JSON file detailing the list of cars & rentals and the output is also formatted in a JSON file that is detailing the rental price.  
All prices are stored as integers (in cents)  

In each level, we are adding a new feature or change, requiring a code restructuring and possibly a global change on the workflow as a whole.

To run each script, just move to the level's folder with `cd ` and run `python main.py`.  

The input is read from  data/input.json and the output is written in data/output.json.
